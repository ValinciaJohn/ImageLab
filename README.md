# ImageLab: Interactive Segmentation and Analysis 🖼️

## 📌 Project Overview  
**ImageLab** is a powerful and interactive image segmentation tool that enables users to explore various segmentation techniques and assess their effectiveness. With built-in features like **K-means clustering** and **Sobel edge detection**, the app allows for comprehensive image analysis. Additionally, users can simulate real-world conditions by adding noise and apply contours to segmentation results.

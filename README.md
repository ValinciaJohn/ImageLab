### **ImageLab**
**ImageLab** is a powerful and interactive image segmentation tool designed to help users explore various segmentation techniques and evaluate their effectiveness. With **ImageLab**, users can upload images, select from multiple segmentation methods, and perform detailed analysis using built-in features like **K-means clustering** and **Sobel edge detection**. The app also detects contours from the Sobel edge detection and applies them to the K-means results for enhanced segmentation. Additionally, users can add noise to the images before segmentation to simulate real-world conditions and understand the impact of noise on different methods. The app provides an option to download the segmented or processed images, allowing users to save their results for further analysis.
